== Description ==

Quick Assortments Cost of Goods & Margins is a free plugin that allows you to track the profit of your store, products and categories. 
This plugin seamlessly integrates with WooCommerce and lets you manage cost prices for your items and instantly see the impact of changes on your margins and markups.

= Benefits =

* Manage Cost Prices, Markup and Margins for products and variations
 
* Understand the impact of markdowns and campaign
 
* Use the powerful margin and profit reports and dashboards to support your decision making

= Why use this plugin? =
 
Whether you produce your own products, drop-ship, or buy through wholesale, you want to track the profitability of your products and your store. 
To do this, you’ll need to manage the cost price of your products.

These Cost Prices (sometimes referred to as ‘direct costs’) are called the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and we have integrated dedicated fields to manage these in your WooCommerce product pages. 

= What is COGS and how does it help me? = 
 
COGS is sometimes also referred to as ‘cost of sales’ or ‘cost of merchandise’ but in short it refers to the production or purchase costs for products sold in your store. 

Technically, these costs are an expense of your business, and in the end they reduce the revenue your store makes from selling. 

So far not a big deal, but once your business grows, it might get tricky to keep track of profitability all of your products.

This plugin allows you to plan, simulate and summarise both your costs, stock value and margins in one place in the WooCommerce product pages so you get an instant overview of how your business is doing.

= Why would I manage my Gross Margin? =

As a store owner, you calculate a variety of figures to determine the health and performance of your business. 

One of these figures is Gross Margin, which is an important factor for you when assessing your business risk and profitability or when you are setting prices for your goods or services.
It’s not always easy to understand the impact of changes in cost and sales prices, especially when your stores grows.

In the WooCommerce product pages, we have created a neat overview to track all of these changes and show the final gross margin for all your products.

= 3 reasons why it’s important to calculate Gross Margin =
 
**Profitability**
Knowing the gross margin for your products is essential in assessing your store’s profitability. 
That sounds like a no brainer, but in reality it is easier said than done. 
Calculating Gross Margin lets you know how much of profit you’ve got in order to meet obligations other than those related to your products and services.
With this plugin, you can create simulations and different scenarios to see the impact of changes in pricing on margin. Instantly.
 
**Save Money & Resource**
We have taken the calculation of gross margin a step further by evaluating it on a per product basis. This can help you determine if higher cost materials have been incorporated into production. Perhaps too much is spent on a particular product. 

Your gross margin may indicate a need to use materials at a lower cost, or buy your products at a lower cost. Maybe you need to increase your retail price slightly to make more money. 
This plugin will help you to determine just that.
 
**Break-even Point**
Calculating gross margin is also a key element to knowing your company’s break-even point. Your break-even point tells you the amount of revenue you must make in order for to make your business a success.

= For Merchants, By Merchants =

All of our plugins are developed *for merchants, by merchants*. With over *25 years* of combined experience in merchandising and retail, we understand what it takes to run a business.

> Check out our other add-ons on [our website](https://quickassortments.com/) if you are interested in additional reporting and sales forecasting extensions.

If you want to know more about merchandise planning or assortment planning, don’t hesitate to check out our [Merchant Support](https://quickassortments.com/) pages
Here you find lots of information on anything related to merchandising and retail.

> You will notice Net Profit and Margin are NOT calculated the moment the plugin is installed. It is because the Orders in the past are not present in the charts (yet).
The reason for this is that we are launching a forecasting and Order Management tool in April 2020, for which we had to create the algorithms in a different way than are standard in WooCommerce charts. 
Of course, if you can't wait till April next year, please reach out to us directly at support@quickassortments.com then we can help you to manually import all historic data.

*Acknowledgment: For version 2.0.0 we have borrowed code from the [WooCommerce Admin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-admin/) plugin by WooCommerce. So, a lot of thanks to the folks behind this plugin.*

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I would like to see more history in my charts, is this possible? =

Yes! We are working on an automatic import of all historic data and this will be part of a future release.
The way we calculate margin and profitability is slightly different from how some of the standard calculations are done in WooCommerce. The reason for that is because we are currently developing an advanced forecasting and Order Management tool that will be ready beginning next year.
